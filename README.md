# **User Trust in AI Agents: A Processing-Based Interactive Experiment**

## **Overview**
This project is an interactive experiment built using the **Processing** programming language to study user trust in different AI virtual agents. Participants register by providing their demographic details and then rate multiple virtual agents based on predefined trust-related questions. The data is stored for analysis.

## **Features**
- **User Registration**: Participants enter their name, gender, age, education level, and experience.
- **Virtual Agents**: Three AI agents (Male, Female, Androgynous) are presented to the user.
- **Trust Evaluation**: Users rate agents based on predefined trust questions.
- **Data Storage**: Participant details and rating responses are saved in text files.
- **Shuffled Agent Presentation**: Agents are randomized to avoid order bias.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Processing (Java-based framework)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** for modular design
- **File Handling** for saving participant data and ratings

## **Setup Instructions**
1. **Install Processing**: If you donâ€™t have Processing installed, download it from [processing.org](https://processing.org/download/).
2. **Clone or Download the Project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/TrustAI_Experiment.git
   cd TrustAI_Experiment
